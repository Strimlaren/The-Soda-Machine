## The Soda-Machine

### Setup
To make sure this awesome game works as intended inside the console of PyCharm (and possible other IDEs), 
you need to make sure your console will react as expected to the system("cls") command. In PyCharm:

1. Select 'Edit Configurations' from the 'Run' menu.
2. Under the 'Execution' section, select 'Emulate terminal in output console'

### "Playing" instructions
This game is a fictitious soda-machine that can dispense individual soda cans as well as randomized/customized 
crates full of soda. Use the arrow keys to navigate the menus and Enter to confirm selections.

#### Note:
By default, the menu delay setting will be at 3 seconds, so confirmation dialogues will take a bit longer. During 
that time the soda-machine will not be taking any commands. This can, among other things, be changed in the settings.

Enjoy!
